# Telerik UI for Blazor Virtual Classroom Training Starter Project

Welcome to the sample project repository of [Telerik UI for Blazor getting started video course](https://learn.telerik.com/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/27/telerik-ui-for-blazor). The training course is developed to help you get started with the Blazor framework and the Telerik UI for Blazor components and features. It aims to put you in the shoes of an engineer who adds new features to an existing sample application called RSP Issue Tracker. 

In this repo, you will find the starter source code needed for the hands-on exercises that are part of the different chapters throughout the training. If you would like to run side-by-side the start and final sample projects, you can find the one including Telerik UI for Blazor components in the dedicated repo [here](https://github.com/telerik/RpsTrackerBlazorTelerikUI).

## About the Telerik UI for Blazor Video Course

All users with an active trial or commercial license have access to a  [Telerik UI for Blazor getting started video course](https://learn.telerik.com/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/27/telerik-ui-for-blazor)  available in  [Telerik's Virtual Classroom](https://learn.telerik.com/learn).

The first chapter of the training is an introduction to the Blazor framework. It covers various foundation topics such as Blazor Server and WebAssembly hosting models, Blazor components life cycle, data binding, using a code-behind approach for component creation, and more.

The rest of the modules include an introduction to [Telerik UI for Blazor component library](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui) and different approaches for installation and setup. Further, you will enhance an existing sample RPS issue tracker Blazor application with one of the built-in themes and basic components like Button. Then, you learn how to use and configure more advanced components, such as [Blazor Data Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/grid/overview), [Calendar](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/calendar/overview), and [Charts](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/chart/overview). The final module is dedicated to deployment and will show you how to deploy both Blazor Server and WASM applications to Azure.

The training also covers important Telerik UI for Blazor built-in features, such as [Globalization](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/overview) and [Localization](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/globalization/localization), [Accessibility](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/accessibility/overview), and [Keyboard Navigation](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/accessibility/keyboard-navigation), as well as options for using the [Telerik Document Processing](https://www.telerik.com/document-processing-libraries) and [Telerik Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx)  in Blazor Applications.
